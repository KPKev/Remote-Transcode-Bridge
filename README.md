# Unified GPU & CPU Transcoding Script for Sabnzbd

A robust, single-file post-processing script for Sabnzbd that intelligently transcodes media to a web-optimized MP4 format. It prioritizes a remote NVIDIA GPU for maximum speed but automatically falls back to local CPU transcoding if the GPU is unavailable, ensuring your media always gets processed.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Hybrid Transcoding**: Prioritizes remote NVIDIA GPU (NVENC) via SSH and seamlessly falls back to local CPU (`libx264`) if needed.
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Automatically detects if the remote GPU host is unreachable and switches to CPU mode.
- **Force CPU Option**: A flag in `transcode.conf` allows you to force CPU transcoding for testing or maintenance.
- **Real-time Progress**: A live, responsive progress bar with a "spinner" shows that transcoding is active, even during slow CPU operations.
- **Automatic Format Detection**: Only transcodes files that aren't already in a web-optimized MP4 format.
- **Media Server Integration**: Built-in, automatic library refresh notifications for Plex, Sonarr, and Radarr.
- **Highly Configurable**: A clean `transcode.conf` file controls all quality, connection, and behavior settings.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Creates detailed, timestamped logs for both the main script and the `ffmpeg` process, with automatic rotation.

## üìã Requirements

### System
- **Sabnzbd**: For post-processing integration.
- **FFmpeg**: Must be available in the Sabnzbd container's environment.
- **`stdbuf`**: Required for real-time progress updates (part of `coreutils`).
- **SSH Client**: For connecting to the remote GPU machine.

### Remote GPU Machine (Optional, for GPU acceleration)
- An NVIDIA GPU with NVENC support.
- A running SSH server (like OpenSSH).
- FFmpeg with NVENC enabled.
- Correctly configured SSH key-based authentication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Place Files**: Copy `transcode-to-mp4-with-gpu.sh` and `transcode.conf` into your Sabnzbd `scripts` directory.
2.  **Make Executable**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x transcode-to-mp4-with-gpu.sh
    ```
3.  **Configure**: Edit `transcode.conf` with your specific settings (SSH, media servers, etc.).
4.  **Setup in Sabnzbd**: In Sabnzbd's settings, point your categories to `transcode-to-mp4-with-gpu.sh`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`transcode.conf`)

All script behavior is controlled by `transcode.conf`.

## üîÑ How It Works

1.  **Analysis**: The script is triggered by Sabnzbd and finds the largest video file in the completed download. It uses `ffprobe` to check its container, video codec, and audio codec.
2.  **Decision**: The script transcodes the file if it's not already a compliant `h264/aac` MP4 file.
3.  **Transcode Path Selection**:
    - It checks the `FORCE_CPU_TRANSCODE` flag. If `true`, it skips to the CPU path.
    - It attempts to connect to the `SSH_HOST`. If the host is unreachable, it logs the failure and automatically switches to the CPU path.
    - If the connection is successful, it uses the GPU path.
4.  **Execution**:
    - **GPU Path**: Streams the video file via SSH to the remote machine, where `ffmpeg` performs a high-speed NVENC transcode.
    - **CPU Path**: Executes `ffmpeg` locally using the `libx264` software encoder, which is slower but highly compatible.
5.  **Progress Monitoring**: While `ffmpeg` runs, a progress loop reads its output in real-time, printing a status line with a spinner, percentage, speed, and ETA to the Sabnzbd UI.
6.  **Cleanup & Notification**: After a successful transcode, the original file is deleted, and the script sends API calls to Sonarr, Radarr, and Plex to trigger library scans.

## üìÅ File Structure

```
/sabnzbd/scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transcode-to-mp4-with-gpu.sh  # The main, unified script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transcode.conf                # All user configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                         # Directory for log files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ..._main.log              # Main script activity log
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ..._cpu.log               # Log file for ffmpeg CPU process
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                    # Prevents logs from being committed
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Frozen Progress Bar**: If the progress bar freezes, check the main log file (`..._main.log`) in the `logs` directory. The progress reader may have timed out (default is 5 minutes).
- **Transcoding Fails**: Check the `ffmpeg` log (`..._cpu.log` or a future `..._gpu.log`). This contains the direct, unfiltered output from the `ffmpeg` command and will show any encoding errors.
- **SSH Connection Fails**: Test your SSH connection manually from within the Sabnzbd container to ensure keys are set up correctly and the host is reachable. `ssh -v -p [PORT] [USER]@[HOST]`.
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure the script has execute permissions (`chmod +x`). Also, ensure the user running Sabnzbd has permission to write to the `logs` directory and the media output directories.
